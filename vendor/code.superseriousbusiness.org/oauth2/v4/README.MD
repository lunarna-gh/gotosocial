You should probably use the original upstream library, this is largely for our own usecase in [GoToSocial](https://codeberg.org/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial), and provides zero compatibility guarantees between versions.

Versioning is a little complex but attempts to follow upstream as `ssb-v4.5.3-x` where `ssb` = superseriousbusiness, `v4.5.3` is the upstream version, and `x` is our own revision starting at 1 for each fresh upstream release version.

A copy of the upstream development branch can be found at `upstream-main`, and our main branch will (MUST!) be kept up-to-date with this with regular rebases.
